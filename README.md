# Introduction
Cleft lip and palate is the most common with-born disease. It appears in approximately 0.02% of all new-borns. The cleft of the lip and palate is surgically closed in early childhood (primary surgery) and
it is well-known, that this surgery creates scar tissue which might influence growth of the maxillofacial
complex as well as occlusion (bite). This study is part of a multicentre prospective, randomised,
controlled clinical trial studying non-syndromic Caucasian children with unilateral cleft lip and palate,
which evaluated timing and method of the primary surgery in 450 patients. In Trial 1, which the Aarhus
group belongs to, the surgical variable was timing. All patients received surgical closure of the lip at 3
months of age; then, half of the patients received closure of the palate at 1 year of age (group A) and
the other half at 3 years of age (group B). The outcome we want to look at is craniofacial growth and
occlusion.
The Aarhus material consists of 84 patients followed from birth to 21 years of age. Patients received
orthodontic treatment at the age of 8 (OR I) in the mixed dentition before they received secondary
surgery for closure of the cleft in the alveolar process. When the patients were in the permanent
dentition a second orthodontic treatment (OR II) was performed. Lateral cephalograms and dental
casts were taken before (age 12) and after (age 16) this orthodontic treatment. At 16 years and after
OR II the patient is considered at the end of treatment and occlusion and growth can be evaluated.
Occlusion is evaluated on the study models taken at age 8, 12 and 16 with two different scoring systems
[Goslon (score 1-5) and Pinheira (score 0-52)]. Craniofacial growth was evaluated by assessing specific
angles between anatomical landmarks on cephalometric radiographs.
The aim of this project is to assess whether the abovementioned measurements at age 8 can be used
to predict the craniofacial growth and occlusion at a later age. It involves the analysis and evaluation
of several predictive models on tabular data, with a particular focus on explainability of the model.

## goals 
The overall goal for this project is to create a way for dentist to estimate the final Pinheria score, from the initial measurement.
## Problems
The first problem we found was the data with a $n=123$ it is difficult to create a neural network, also we didnt find any visible depence within the data.
